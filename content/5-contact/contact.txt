About: 

SUSAN INGLETT GALLERY is located in the heart of Chelsea in a ground  floor space at 522 West 24th Street. The gallery provides representation for a range of artists, emerging to established, working across media. Continuing a pattern established early in its history, the gallery consciously develops a program of surprising juxtapositions within and between exhibitions alternating between single artist shows, curated group exhibitions and historical exhibitions. Gallery artists have appeared recently in the Hammer Biennial, Paris Triennale, Whitney Biennial, the Venice Biennale, the Carnegie International and Greater New York at P.S. 1 among many international venues.

Susan Inglett represents Benjamin Degen, Eric Fertman, Hope Gangloff, George Herms, Marcia Kure, Allison Miller, Shaun O’Dell, Robyn O’Neil, Beverly Semmes, Greg Smith, William Villalongo and Ryan Wallace.

In addition to the gallery, Susan Inglett produced prints and multiples as [I.C. Editions, Inc.] [1] To date she has published the work of Barbara Bloom, Bruce Conner, Marcel Dzama, Anna Gaskell, Allan McCollum, Paul Noble, Claes Oldenburg, Robyn O’Neil, Catherine Opie, Richard Prince, Al Ruppersberg, Philip Taaffe, Terry Winters, and Andrea Zittel among others. In 1998, Susan Inglett co-founded and organized the Editions|Artists Book Fair to 2013.
