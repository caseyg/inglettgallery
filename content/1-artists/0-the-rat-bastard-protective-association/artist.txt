Text: The Rat Bastard Protective Association (RBPA) is an inflammatory, close-knit community of artists and poets who lived and worked together in a building they dubbed "Painterland" in the Fillmore neighborhood of mid-century San Francisco. The idiosyncratic group included Wallace Berman, Bob Branaman, Joan Brown, Bruce Conner, Jean Conner, Jay DeFeo, George Herms, Wally Hedrick, Manuel Neri and Michael McClure.
