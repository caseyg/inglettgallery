Susan Inglett is pleased to present the most recent addition to Paul Noble's urban development Nobson Newtown, "A" and "Paul's Place" from 31 October to 14 December. These first etchings published by I.C. Editions will be paired with a selection of Eighteenth Century architectural follies from the hand of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. 

Paul Noble has devoted the past six years to the creation of Nobson Newtown, a cityscape built according to the perceived needs and preferences of its inhabitants. Of course as self-annointed spokesperson, this particular folly tells us as much about the artist as it provides yet another example of questionable city planning. Rendered in the jerrybuilt scaffolding of an invented type font, the artist embellishes each place name with enough attributes and details to engage even the most casual visitor. With Nobson Newtown, Noble joins a long line of distinguished artists who have invented fantastic and eccentric worlds through which to explore their own psychological landscape. Located on the outskirts of town, "A" and“Paul’s Place” adds sculpture park and sensory respite to a burgeoning “Nobson Central” replete with “Nobspital,” “Lidonob, "and, of course, “Paul’s Palace.” 

Paul Noble's work may be seen this Fall in the exhibition "Drawing Now : 

Eight Propositions" at the Museum of Modern Art. "A" and "Paul's Place" may also be seen in November at Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, England and in a survey of the artist’s work early next year at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo. The artist is represented by Maureen Paley/Interim, London and Gorney Bravin Lee, NYC.
