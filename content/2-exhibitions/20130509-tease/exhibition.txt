Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present new works by Marcia Kure in her second solo exhibition with the Gallery from 9 May to 15 June 2013. A reception for the artist will be held Thursday evening, 9 May from 6 to 8 PM.


We feel content and safe within the confines of the world we understand. "Tease" intends to poke holes, cut into, and fragment the perceptual matrix that is our world; daring the viewer to imagine existential possibilities beyond the familiar and the ordinary. "Tease" is a populated space, a universe of hybrid bodies and masked and secret things existing at the very edges of our daily lives.

The realities described by drawings, collages and sculptures in "Tease" are only imaginable through access to terrifying and exhilarating knowledge-knowledge we gain by prying open the locked closet, gazing into the dark sky, chanting a ritual song, or opening closed windows of the mind.

With familiar objects such as children's toys, kitchen utensils, bed sheets, rugs, and other common household items, "Tease" probes our fear of the unknown and the hidden, and tickles the pleasure of revelation. It asks the question: to what extent does the acquisition of more knowledge contribute to the (un-)making of the human? What is the existential value of curiosity, that primal urge to peer into the unknown? What desires are fulfilled or lost in encounters with partially obscured images and objects on the verge of disappearance/recovery? 

"Tease" is a place of possibility, a space of becoming; it is an unsettling, off-kilter space, not unlike the world outside. It is at the moment of our greatest discomfort when we are compelled to ask the most important questions about our lives, and our world.

"Tease" is that place.
