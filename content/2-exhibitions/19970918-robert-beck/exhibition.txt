Susan Inglett is pleased to present an exhibition of recent work by ROBERT BECK from 18 September to 25 October 1997. A reception for the artist will be held from 6 to 8 the evening of 18 September. 

With this exhibition of drawings and Polaroids, Robert Beck enhances the resonance and scope of two of the various media he has exhibited in the past as components of larger thematically-based installations. 

Beck's drawings are done after illustrations found in arcane sources, such as textbook case-studies, hunting manuals, or product brochures. When these odd yet familiar renderings are exhibited interspersed with his own "original" drawings, each bearing a Figure caption, fact is mistaken for fiction, self for other, and author for reader. Thus, Beck is able to reiterate an uncertainty akin to his earlier, "evidentiary" work. 

Beck's new Polaroids create intimately-scaled and inviting worlds that are by turns fantastic or mundane, gruesome or benign. Through the artist's lens, commonplace images -- a brick wall, a cornfield, a body on a bed -- become windows onto more complex worlds, vibrant with color yet dark with implication. 

Whether making full-scale installations or small-scale drawings and Polaroids, Robert Beck walks a fine line between fact and fiction. Loaded with suggestion and contradiction, the work continues to rely upon the viewer for its ultimate resolution.
