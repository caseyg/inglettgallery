Susan Inglett is pleased to present a new project by Marcel Dzama 9 September to 9 October 2004.

Marching single file across a wide open manila field, the army of Marcel Dzama prevails once again. Man, woman, child and/or beast, people this merry band of misfits. Missionaries that they are, Dzama's soldiers travel without portfolio, free to serve at the whim of their respective master. Obediently, these hybrid creatures act out the fantasies, frustrations, victories of our daily lives and nocturnal reveries. In addition to the five large screenprints with hand-coloring which comprise this project, the gallery will also premiere a series of three dimensional Dzama action figures produced by product design company Cereal art.

Marcel Dzama, a Canadian born artist living in Winnipeg, has exhibited widely throughout Europe and the States. He is also a member of the artists' collective Royal Art Lodge which is currently traveling an exhibition originating at the Drawing Center in New York. Dzama is represented by the David Zwirner Gallery, NYC.
