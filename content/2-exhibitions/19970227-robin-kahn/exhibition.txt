SUSAN INGLETT is pleased to present an exhibition of paintings and sculpture by Robin Kahn from 27 February to 12 April 1997. A reception will be held 11 AM to 1 PM the morning of 1 March. 

Reading, a well worn avenue of escape, provides the inspiration for this recent body of work from Robin Kahn. Cherubic heads bowed in quiet contemplation form the centerpiece of the exhibition. Each ceramic bust bends in unison over a book, reading or writing, lost in thought. The paintings reflect the mood, capturing the experience of reading as veiled and ethereal dreamscape. Taking a moment from her work, a woman turns to the morning papers only to become lost in a whirlwind of images and text. The reader, or viewer, is transported to a world where fact mingles readily with fiction, a world of possibilities. The paintings each in turn represent that moment when reality and fantasy become one and dreams really do come true.

Additional: The exhibition will be on view at the gallery located 100 Wooster Street/2 Floor Tuesday to Saturday 11 to 6 PM. Additional work is on view at the Nassau County Museum of Art in an exhibition curated by Donald Kuspit entitled "Feminine Image".
