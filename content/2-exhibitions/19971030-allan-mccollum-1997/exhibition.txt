Susan Inglett is pleased to present a new project by ALLAN McCOLLUM, Visible Markers. The exhibition will continue from 30 October to 13 December 1997 with a reception for the artist Saturday, 8 November 1997 from 6 to 8 PM. 

Allan McCollum’s Visible Markers take the shape of thousands of multi-colored concrete blocks measuring 2” high by 8” long by 2 1/2” wide . Each block is cast in one of six colors; brick red, chocolate brown, coal black, stone grey, lemon yellow, lime green, and each bears a deep imprint of the word “Thanks” . The project, the artist’s first multiple, will be offered as an unlimited edition in boxed sets of six blocks in each of the six colors. 

Visible Markers lend physical form to a common verbal gesture. The act of giving “Thanks” encourages our consideration of the behavior itself with attendant sentiments and motivations. The material quality of the concrete and the shape of the marker suggests diverse readings. The concrete evokes both monument and mausoleum while the shape is at once ingot and brick.	The subtle shift in our understanding of Visible Markers parallels the subtle shift in usage and understanding of the word “Thanks”, heartfelt sentiment or acknowledgement of obligation. 

With this project, perhaps more than with any other, the artist explores his notion of the art object as something that obtains it’s significance through the process of its exchange, rather than merely through its making and its presentation. He hopes that people will appreciate this project as both an object and an action. 

To encourage the exchange of “Thanks” the artist and Gallery will give away one hundred single Visible Markers to friends and colleagues during the course of the exhibition.
