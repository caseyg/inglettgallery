“To work, a story doesn’t have to be real – it has to be true.”
—Orson Welles 

Christopher Ulivo’s paintings on paper are indeed true. Narratives woven from a wealth of colorful detail and complexity, they could be nothing less. In this body of work, Ulivo creates a parallel universe as multidimensional as our own. Here humble woodsmen roam the borderlands of a primeval occidental forest. This ancient unforgiving landscape proves a formidable match for its rough hewn inhabitants. Vainly they work towards taming their surroundings and mastering their universe. As viewers, we look helplessly on all too aware of the tenuous nature of the struggle and the long journey ahead.
