I.C. is pleased to announce an exhibition of ROBERT BECK's recent photo-based Habeas Corpus series with related conceptual objects and photographs. 

The show will open Thursday 6 October with a reception for the artist from 6 to 8 PM, and continue to 5 November l994. 

The first three works of Beck's ongoing project collectively titled Habeas Corpus will be on view together for the first time. The three pieces are fabricated reproductions of the photo essays contained in the pages of popular, true crime novels. Bearing an uncanny resemblance to the prototype, each work tells its tale with photographs the artist has either staged, appropriated from the media, or borrowed from family photo albums. As if ripped from the binding of a paperback book, the 12 or 14 pages of each essay appear pinned to the wall in a montage-like presentation of an enigmatic story, one which the viewer is invited to piece together. 

Continuing his investigation of crime and criminality, Beck will exhibit several "evidence bags" containing personal items, everyday objects or childhood belongings packaged according to police guidelines for the proper handling of evidence. 

Later in the month, Beck will screen a new videotape, "Girlfriend' In A Coma". Approximately twenty minutes long, the tape deftly juxtaposes the images and music of the British pop band The Smiths and its lead singer and lyricist Morrissey, with video material created by the artist to examine his once personal identification with a popular cult personality. 

With this first one person exhibition, Beck successfully expands the scope of his artistic production, moving beyond his work of the past in video to a variety of other media. The exhibition will be on view at I.C. located 100 Wooster Street/2 floor open Wednesday to Saturday 1 to 6 PM and by appointment. For more information please contact Susan Inglett at 212/343-0573.
