As of September, I.C. located at 100 Wooster Street/2 floor will be open to the public Wednesday to Saturday 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM and by appointment.   The opening exhibition will feature a selection of I.C. Editions including projects by Annette Lemieux, Richard Prince, Erika Rothenberg, and Jessica Diamond, Sol LeWitt, and Lawrence Weiner.

The print/multiple medium is well suited to contemporary issues in art including examinations of originality, use of modern technology, and art as socio-political commentary. Through computer technology Annette Lemieux "Stolen Faces" is able to pixilate or mask the identities of a batallion of soldiers.  Using a common media device, the artist effectively mocks the media's and our own facile attempts to protect our victims.  
Where Lemieux chooses to beat them at their own game, Erika Rothenberg joins them.  "GREETINGS" looks and acts like a boxed set of commercial all-occasion cards intended for wide distribution. Rothenberg makes a card for every occasion and enough cards for  everyone - rapists, terrorists, and psychotics included.
"DO-IT-YOURSELF" with Jessica Diamond, Sol LeWitt, and Lawrence Weiner also realizes the potential of the medium to reach the masses.  Published in unlimited edition, the artists provide instructions and materials for you to execute their work at home.  Its the ultimate in home improvement projects.
