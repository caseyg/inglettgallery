Susan Inglett is pleased to present the work of ALYSON SHOTZ in an exhibition which runs from 17 January 2002 to 16 February 2002. A reception for the artist will be held Thursday evening 17 January from 6 to 8 PM. 

In her largest installation to date, Shotz contributes to recent experiments in the genetic sciences with a life form of her own invention. Self-irrigating, mobile, indestructible, her “rubber” tree engulfs the Gallery in a tangle of vulcanized leaves, surgical tubing, and casters. Photographs accompanying the sculpture likewise graft the real and the artificial to suggest the dark beauty of this unnatural science while questioning the wisdom of its pursuit.
