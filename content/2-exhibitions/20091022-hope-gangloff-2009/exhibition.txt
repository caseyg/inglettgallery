Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present the work of Hope Gangloff in her third solo exhibition with the gallery from 22 October to 25 November 2009. Concurrently, Gallery II will feature new work by Gavin Anderson. A reception for the artists will be held Thursday evening, 22 October from 6 to 8 PM. 

Hope Gangloff is a collector of moments, moods, objects, and patterns. Primarily portraits of her friends, Gangloff’s work glamourizes the mundane with a signature style. She describes her role among friends as observer, documenting daily activities, exchanges, and reflections. Objects and patterns that she finds visually compelling also figure into her compositions, rendered with the precision of a master draftsperson. Through this body of work, Gangloff offers a tantalizing glimpse into the lives of others—her fragmented narratives leave the viewer longing to know more. 

After her first solo exhibition at Susan Inglett Gallery in 2006, Hope Gangloff went on to have solo exhibitions in Los Angeles and Rome, in addition to participating in group exhibitions at the Weatherspoon Art Museum, The Art Center of South Florida, and with Susan Inglett Gallery at the 2009 Armory Show. She is a graduate of Cooper Union. 

Susan Inglett Gallery is also pleased to present the work of Gavin Anderson in Gallery II. Most recently shown at Kidd Yellin in the summer of 2009, Anderson’s light-filled canvases are dreamlike meditations on collective experience.
