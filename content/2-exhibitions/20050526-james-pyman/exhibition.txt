Susan Inglett is pleased to present the work of JAMES PYMAN from 26 May 2005 to 25 June 2005. There will be an opening reception Thursday evening 26 May from 6 to 8 PM. 

James Pyman’s work takes its starting point from various sources - photographs and found images, pop music, genre fiction, anecdotes. Each piece comprises a number of reference points and weaves together strands of history, popular culture and autobiography. The final form may be comic books and magazine projects or large scale drawings and book works. The large drawings describe remembered moments and often appear to be unrelated to one another, a sense of dislocation is created by the scale of the works and their apparently random contextualization. The publications use existing (and often marginalized) forms of publishing such as comic books and fanzines as a structure that can be manipulated to express more abstract or emotional concerns. 

The work for this exhibition is drawn from the last ten years and comprises three large scale drawings and a number of recent, smaller drawings. The large drawings are I must read ‘ Moby Dick’ , an image of a whale’s tail which exists as a visual aide memoir : Kennel, a photo-realist drawing of Snoopy’s doghouse set within a suburban landscape ; Zero to One, an drawing of a young girl drawing herself - an image of infinite regression portraying development of a personal iconography. The series of small drawings (sourced from postcards, personal photography and press agency images) are for inclusion in a forthcoming publication based on traditional English folk music. 

Pyman’s most recently completed artists’ book is Wilf - A Life in PIctures. The book took the structure of a biography documenting the careers of a group of British newspaper cartoonists from the postwar period to the 1990s. In this form the book could also examine the relationship between 20th century political and cultural events and trace the development of illustrative tropes and narrative approaches to describe the events. The intention was to use a fictional character's visual history to analyze how codes of illustration and drawing evolve and modify to create a mass graphic language. 

A native of England who lives and works in London, James Pyman has recently had solo exhibitions at the Norwich Gallery, Norwich and Cabinet in London. This is the artist's first solo exhibition in the USA. We are grateful for the assistance from the British Council USA.
