Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present new paintings by Hope Gangloff in her fourth solo exhibition at the Gallery from 3 February to 12 March 2011. Gallery II will feature new work from Robyn O’Neil in her first presentation here. A reception for the artists will be held Thursday evening, 3 February from 6 to 8 PM. 

Hope Gangloff’s is a life examined and perceptively recorded with unfailing attention to detail. Paintings of friends and colleagues capture a personal American Vision, a modern day Dick and Nicole Diver who by some turn of events have found themselves inhabiting a Brooklyn cold-water flat.	Psychological portraits, each picture hints at a back story and inner life as suggested by the artist’s frenzied line and distinctive palette. Gangloff paints a picture of being in a modern world, an eloquent hard won beauty. Concurrently a survey of Hope Gangloff’s work can be seen at the Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut in her first solo museum show 30 January to 4 June. 

Gallery II will feature the first exhibition of Robyn O’Neil since joining the Gallery. This show of graphite drawings will serve to announce our representation of O’Neil and her upcoming October show in the main gallery.	Well known for her epic narrative drawings, this presentation will reverse course with jewel-like renderings of extraordinary power and poignancy. O’Neil was recently honored with a solo exhibition at the Des Moines Art Center. She first came to our attention in the 2004 Whitney Biennial and was seen more recently in New York in the exhibition “Dargerism” at the American Folk Museum. 

Susan Inglett Gallery will participate in the VIP Art Fair (www.vipartfair.com) from 22 January to 30 January featuring work by Eric Fertman, Hope Gangloff, Robyn O’Neil, and William Villalongo.
