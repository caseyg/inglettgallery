SUSAN INGLETT is pleased to present an exhibition of sculpture, painting and drawing by Peter Boynton from 17 April to 31 May 1997. A reception for the artist will be held the evening of Thursday 17 April from 6 PM to 8 PM. 

Peter Boynton continues to embellish on the strategies and formal concerns of modernism with wit and sheer whimsy in this exhibition of recent sculpture and painting. Having devoted earlier bodies of work to refurbishing Classic Modern forms using such diverse contemporary technologies as latex and Fluffernutter, Boynton's recent revisions find their inspiration in the Ancient Silk Routes of India and the Far East. Jewel-like glass beads set in extraordinary hand-woven wire cages replace past constructs of ping pong balls and balloons. At once exotic, suggestive, and comical, the sculptures have neither lost their power to amuse nor their ability to turn High Art on end. 

The paintings and drawings echo these structures rendering brilliant bursts of light and saturated color in true comic-book style. The exhibition will be on view at the gallery located 100 Wooster Street/2 Floor Tuesday to Saturday 11 AM to 6 PM. For more information contact Susan Inglett at 212/343-0573 and fax 212/343-0574.
