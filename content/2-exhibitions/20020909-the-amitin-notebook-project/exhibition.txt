Susan Inglett is pleased to present selections from Michael Byron's "The Amitin Notebook Project" from 19 September to 26 October 2002. There will be a reception for the artist from 6 to 8 PM Thursday 19 September. 

Writing for a 1991 exhibition catalogue from the Witte de With Rotterdam, Holland Cotter described Michael Byron's work as "hard to categorize : he seemed to be inventing his own visual culture. It was a rich one, with the political and the private and high and low engaged in enigmatic narratives, but its expressive metabolism was unusual. We are accustomed to art juiced up with formal or theoretical imperatives. Byron's work by contrast, relaxes these and has the slow-building almost amorphous theatrical pull of a dream." 

A dream in 239 frames, "The Amitin Notebook Project" sprang to life when a worn, leather-bound notebook discovered among the hoard of an antiquarian bookseller came unhinged. Liberated from its binding but not its history, Byron felt free to forge his response with a variety of materials. The result is a journey through the creative process. In a succession of sheets the artist turns abstract thought concrete, one idea and sketch suggesting the next, images drifting on and and off the page and in and out of consciousness. To experience this work fully is to enter the dream state in which it was created. Genuine, spontaneous and intuitive, Michael Byron's work may be hard to categorize, but it is always familiar. 

"The Amitin Notebook Project" was exhibited in its entirety early this year at the Contemporary Art Museum, St. Louis and the Blaffer Gallery, the Art Museum of the University of Houston. Michael Byron's work may be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, NYC; Whitney Museum of American Art, NYC; St. Louis Art Museum, St. Louis; and the Museum Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam.
