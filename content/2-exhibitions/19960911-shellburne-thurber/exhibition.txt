Susan Inglett is pleased to present an exhibition of photography by SHELLBURNE THURBER from 11 September to 26 October 1996. A reception for the artist will be held the evening of 11 September from 6 to 8 PM. 

Linked together under the banner of the "Boston School", Shellburne Thurber and her peers, David Armstrong, Nan Goldin, Mark Morrisroe, and Jack Pierson, have been at the forefront of a broad new trend. In recent articles for Art in America and Print Collector's Newsletter, Brooks Adams has noted the movement towards "an increased importance of intimist views, and a newfound exoticism of the ordinary". This new humanism manifests itself in work as diverse as the soup kitchens of Rirkrit Tiravanija, the sculptural recyclings of Nari Ward, the fashion shoots of Wolfgang Tillmans, and the oddly familiar photographs of Shellburne Thurber. 

In direct response to the peripatetic wanderings of the previous generation of documentary photographers, Thurber remains firmly planted in her native soil. Friends and family people the spectacle of the everyday in her photographs. Depicting moments of great joy and sadness and everything in between, Shellburne Thurber presents us with the scope of the human condition without ever leaving home.
