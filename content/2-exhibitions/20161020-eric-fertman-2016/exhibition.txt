Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present the recent work of Eric Fertman in his fifth solo exhibition with the Gallery from 20 October through 3 December 2016. Concurrently the Gallery will be exhibiting new paintings by Seth Cameron, “Suns,” his first solo appearance in NYC. A reception for the artists will be held Thursday evening 20 October from 6 to 8 PM.

Slashes of bright metal dance through space with the grace and charm of a teenage boy. “Arms” and “legs” akimbo, it is easy to forget that these simple lines and shapes are just that, hard edge geometries grounded in the rational sciences. Fertman has deployed these ciphers frequently over the past decade, always carved from wood. In his new body of work, their rawness is translated perversely to steel and fine metals. Perversity is Fertman’s stock in trade, trafficking always in the unexpected, whether it’s materials that misbehave or images that behave outside our expectations or just our imaginations. Not since Matt Mullican has a stick figure evoked such empathy, such humanity. Eric Fertman masters hard edge abstraction with an edge.

Eric Fertman was born in 1974 in Boston, MA. He received a BFA from The Cooper Union School of Art and Science and has exhibited nationally, with solo shows at Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (SECCA) in Winston-Salem, NC; The Kemper Museum in Kansas City, MO and in a two-person presentation at Time Equities, Inc., NYC for The Art-in-Buildings Program. Reviews of his work have appeared in Artforum, The New York Times and Sculpture Magazine among others.

“Suns” There is no new thing under the sun. And thus Seth Cameron's new paintings aren’t what they are: in this setting, suns. They represent space, misrepresent scale, and present present color. They parse the parts of painting worth painting about (Figure and Ground, Interactions of Color, Shape and Line, etc.) to delight in thecrisis that follows the existential while resisting any ensuing management. With a cocked eye, they pose repose, lean on ledges, and hang in frames, yet do not pretend to escape landscape. They are perfectly fine with it.

“Suns” is Cameron’s first exhibition in New York and with the gallery, properly as himself. And yet improperly neither – his first, in 2008, being both – as a founding member of The Bruce High Quality Foundation. Born in 1982 in South Carolina, Cameron studied at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art where he now leads The Intradisciplinary Seminar. He lives and works in Brooklyn, continuing the work of Bruce and serving as President of the collective’s free art school, BHQFU. 

The exhibitions will be on view at the gallery located at 522 West 24 Street Tuesday to Saturday 10 AM to 6 PM. For additional information please contact Susan Inglett Gallery at 212 647 9111, fax 212 647 9333 or info@inglettgallery.com
