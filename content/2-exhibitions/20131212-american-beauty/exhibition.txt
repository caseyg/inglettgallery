Susan Inglett Gallery presents “American Beauty” a curatorial project by gallery artist William Villalongo from 12 December 2013 to 1 February 2014. Here Villalongo brings together works by 12 contemporary artists: Nicole Awai, SunTek Chung, Rico Gatson, Mark Thomas Gibson, Alejandro Guzman, Maren Hassinger, Ariel Jackson, Matthew Day Jackson, Dawit L. Petros, Nathaniel Mary Quinn, Naomi Reis and Michael Vahrenwald. A reception for the artists will be held Thursday evening, 12 December from 6 to 8 PM.
Challenging the notion that socially or politically charged content cannot coexist with Beauty and Form, these twelve artists skillfully employ imagination, observation and humor to produce works that engage the viewer with thought and feeling. Informed by a particularly American experience and diverse cultural backgrounds, the artists (conceptually) tow a line between their local environments and a global existence. Lines between form and content do not exist or are blurred purposefully to insist on an art that both interrogates and gives pleasure. 

Though message and medium varies, these artists make clear that beauty does not have to exist in a vacuum, nor in the eye of the beholder, that a work of art can be conscious of the larger world. Villalongo puts to rest hackneyed strictures that “good” art communicates as a self-contained dialogue of “formal” qualities and the idea that the purest expression of art lies inside some mysterious universal ideal. “American Beauty” makes clear that truth and beauty are indeed the natural order.
