Susan Inglett is pleased to present the work of Jessica Dickinson, Angelina Gualdoni, Arturo Herrera, Xylor Jane, Sandeep Mukherjee, Eli Ping, David Reed, Mariah Robertson, Ken Showell, Jack Whitten, and Thomas Zitzwitz in an exhibition curated by gallery artist Eli Ping, “In Side Out”. The exhibition will run from 9 December 2010 to 29 January 2011 with a reception for the artists Thursday evening, 9 December, from 6 to 8 PM. 

Spanning decades and generations, the works in “In Side Out” question the place of a warm and invested aesthetics within the field of abstraction. Working around the strategies of austerity, coolness, and bravado, each emphasizes the interplay of measured craftsmanship and intuitive processes: bodily energy and internal states are cut, pasted, and layered into expressive compositions that conjure unexpected depths. Employing surface and composition to work through the limitations of materiality, these works create moments to look through - evoking the absence that lends observation a contemplative quality.

The Gallery will be closed for the holidays 19 December 2010 to 3 January 2011.
