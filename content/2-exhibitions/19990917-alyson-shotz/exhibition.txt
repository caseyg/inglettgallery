Text: 

...I was lying in bed in the summer and I saw the dust in the sunlight as it came through the window. I was watching these dust particles and then the idea came to me quite spontaneously that each of those particles might be a whole world like our world. I was suddenly struck by this idea of infinite worlds within worlds like Chinese boxes, stretching infinitely in all directions. 
-- Rupert Sheldrake, biologist 

In this her third exhibition at the Gallery, Alyson Shotz employs sculpture, video, photography and images made on the computer to conceive worlds in which humbly produced handmade objects create beautiful yet eerie landscapes that could as easily reside somewhere deep within the body as they could in outer space. 

The video “ Centers of Creation” shows a thriving microscopic universe magnified large. “Gregor Samsa’s Other Dream” is a menacingly unnatural , large white object looking somewhat like a buzzing, multiplying hive and somewhat like a galaxy. The photograms titled “Fly Tracks” resemble fossils of the creatures that once lived in “Gregor Samsa” or they could be tracks of light left by a firefly or shooting stars. 
-- Alyson Shotz, New York July 1999
