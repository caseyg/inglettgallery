Susan Inglett is pleased to present an exhibition of recent work by ROBERT BECK from 11 January to 17 February 1996. A reception for the artist will be held from 6 to 8 the evening of 11 January. 

With this exhibition of nine works, Beck adds to his ongoing series of crime-related projects, Habeas Corpus. While the artist's earlier fabricated true crime novels suggest the possibility of a solution, the recent work leaves the viewer to wander in a "wilderness" of artifacts and evidence. 

Grizzly yet spellbinding, this "enchanted forest" is brought to life with work in a variety of media including video, drawings, Polaroids, and a new true crime series, "The Disappointed". 

Building on strategies developed in the earlier work, Robert Beck weaves together a tale of disparate parts into one conceptual and uncanny whole.
