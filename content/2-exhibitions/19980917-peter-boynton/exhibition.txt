SUSAN INGLETT is pleased to present an exhibition of sculpture by Peter Boynton from 17 September to 24 October 1998. A reception for the artist will be held the evening of Thursday 17 September from 6 PM to 8 PM. 

If Modernism reached its zenith in the architecture and design of Eames, Corbusier, and Nelson, then Peter Boynton has gone up and over the top. In his second exhibition at the Gallery, the artist constructs a quirky, private homage to the Masters, interpreting the tenets of high modernism in low materials. Wire, plastic beads, and papier-mache replace the fine polished woods, fiberglass and polyester resins of a bygone era. 

Applying a bit of modern day alchemy, Boynton transforms base matter into bejeweled follies and side table skyscrapers. Held together by a string and a prayer, Boyntonâ€™s fantastic constructions likewise owe no small debt to the memory of Rube Goldberg. Proudly, the spirit of Charles and Ray and Rube lives on in these glittering pods and teetering towers.
