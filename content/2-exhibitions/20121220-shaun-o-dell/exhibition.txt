Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present new paintings and works on paper by San Francisco based artist Shaun O'Dell in his third exhibition with the Gallery from 20 December 2012 to 9 February 2013. 

Shaun O’Dell writes, "Some of the work in this show utilizes a purely stochastic process. They are the works that were determined by both a predictable action and a random element. However, many of the actions taken to make these paintings depart from the predictable actions required in the stochastic method. In this way I can say that there are seeds of a stochastic process in many of these paintings but at some point my actions became solely improvisational and unpredictable. These intuitive and impulsive acts then guide an interplay between my mind and the material world where I am allowing things to happen, seeing those things happen and then deciding how to respond. At this point I am reacting to my observations spontaneously. It is less self-conscious, less deliberate and open to unknowns. This more indeterminate system supports a feedback loop between my will and the universe. I am modeling a system that is in flux and resists becoming static." 

Concurrently Shaun O’Dell will be exhibiting work with Jack Hanley Gallery and has been seen recently at Inman Gallery, Houston; The A Foundation, Liverpool; CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Art, Berkeley; and the San Francisco Art Institute. His work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the de Young Museum.
