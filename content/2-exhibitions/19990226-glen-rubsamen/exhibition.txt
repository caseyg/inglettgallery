SUSAN INGLETT is pleased to present an exhibition of paintings by Glen Rubsamen from 26 February to 3 April 1999. A reception for the artist will be held the evening of Friday 26 February from 6 PM to 8 PM. 

Glen Rubsamen : classically trained, a keen student of perspective (linear, atmospheric, and optical), shadow (primary and secondary), an advocate of archaic technique (oil on panel with varnish), a contemporary painter. 

Annibale Carracci , Guido Reni and his followers were the first to set forward the rules of the neoclassical or “academic” programme, celebrating the purity and beauty found in an idealized nature. Generations of artists came to Rome and its surroundings to seek inspiration in memories of a bygone era of innocence and dignity. Honoring the traditions and lifestyles of the neoclassical landscape painter, Rubsamen made a personal pilgrimage to the historic sights and bucolic settings of Rome, Greece, Mont Blanc, Paris and, well, Euro Disney. 

The first Academics sought to beautify nature in their paintings, selecting forms more perfect and more ideal than reality. Their architectural follies and Elysian Fields were the stuff of the imagination. More recently Disney and his disciples, the Imagineers, have sought to beautify nature by selecting forms perfect and ideal and making them real. Arcadia is no longer the stuff of dreams, it is here on Earth and it is called Anaheim, Orlando, and Marne la Vallee. 

From the first Academics to the last, the grey area which separates illusion from reality, fact from fiction continues to provide fertile ground for exploration. Not unlike Disney, contemporary artists such as Cindy Sherman and Charles Ray have used new techniques and technologies to manufacture a parallel universe. Their worlds call into question the accepted order. Glen Rubsamen’s paintings are no different. Seduced by picture-perfect sunsets, exotic settings, and pastoral landscapes we are swept up in the fantasy that was Rome and the reality that is the Magic Kingdom. 

Rubsamen has shown most recently at the Witte de With, Rotterdam and had solo gallery exhibitions in Stuttgart, Paris, and Portugal. This is the artist’s first solo show in New York.
