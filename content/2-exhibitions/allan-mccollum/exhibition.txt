Susan Inglett is pleased to present a new project by ALLAN McCOLLUM, More Visible Markers, in Twelve Exciting Colors. The exhibition will continue from 2 November to 9 December 2000 with a reception for the artist Saturday, 4 November 2000 from 6 to 8 PM.

Allan McCollum’s Visible Markers take the shape of hundreds of multi-colored circular tablets measuring 1 3/4” high by 4” in diameter . Each tablet is cast in hydrocal and painted in one of twelve colors: Storm Cloud Grey, Lemon Shine, Linen Sand, Tangy Orange, California Lilac, Stuart Gold, Light Khaki, Red Tulip, Springtime Bloom, Baby Boy Blue, Clearest Ocean Blue, and Fresh Scent Green . Each bears a deep imprint of the word “Thanks” . This project is another installment in a continuum of Visible Markers.The first was produced November 1997 as a series of six concrete ingots pigmented in six colors.

Visible Markers lend physical form to a common verbal gesture. With this project,perhaps more than with any other, the artist explores his notion of the art object as something that obtains it’s significance through the process of its exchange, rather than merely through its making and its presentation. He hopes that by giving “Thanks” people will appreciate Visible Markers as both an object and an action.
