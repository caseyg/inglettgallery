Susan Inglett is pleased to present an exhibition of drawings by DONALD JUDD curated by David Platzker from 23 May to 29 June 1996. 

While Donald Judd was best known for his sculptures, or "specific-objects", his drawings present the best rare evidence of the artist's own hand. 

For the Minimalists, absence of hand was as much an artistic gesture as a political one. In their efforts to redefine and perfect the art object, Judd and contemporaries including Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, and Robert Morris, regularly engaged professional fabricators. By doing so drawing became a necessary tool to communicate the particulars of the work to be executed. 

Additionally, Judd made drawings in order to document sculpture produced or as project proposals. The drawings presented in this exhibition dated 1964 to 1984 describe proposals for a selection of metal and concrete sculptures. 

They are, in essence, the raw material from which Donald Judd would hone, refine, perfect his consummate "specific-object".
