Susan Inglett is pleased to present an exhibition of works on paper by RONA PONDICK from 31 October to 14 December 1996. The exhibition will feature a recently completed limited edition book entitled "I want" published by I.C. Editions along with related drawings, unique books and prints. 

Rona Pondick has chosen the book as the perfect vehicle for her explorations of desire. Filling page after page, sheet after sheet with unspoken expressions of longing, the artist approaches the book as Confessor or diary. Here repetition provides not only a formal structure for the work, as exhibited in the sculpture, but a metaphorical one. The mantra-like repetition of the text, I want, enveloped by the wrappers of the book becomes the physical embodiment of secret or hidden desires. 

The Gallery will exhibit a selection of books and drawings executed over the three year period leading up to the publication of "I want". This limited edition book printed in lithography consists of four double page accordian fold sheets which when fully extended reach eleven feet in length. Each page will also be made available as a single print. 

RONA PONDICK "I want" will run concurrently with her installation "Mine" in the Grand Lobby of the Brooklyn Museum. "Mine" will provide the setting for a performance she has conceived and directed under the auspices of the Artists in Action series sponsored by the Brooklyn Academy of Music to be presented 13 to 16 November.
