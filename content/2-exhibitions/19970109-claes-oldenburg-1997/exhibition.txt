Susan Inglett presents an exhibition of Claes Oldenburg drawings and notebook page studies executed between 1966 and 1994. The work has been selected from the artist's personal archives by David Platzker, co-author of the forthcoming catalogue raisonne of Oldenburg prints, graphics and ephemera to be published by Hudson Hills Press April 1997. Dates for the exhibition are 9 January through 22 February 1997. 

Claes Oldenburg's notebooks provide a rare glimpse of the artist at work. Records of a fertile and extraordinary imagination, each page is replete with images and ideas for possible projects. Collectively the notebooks act as a "Rosetta stone" for the artist providing inspiration and raw material for sculptures, drawings, prints and multiples dating back to the Sixties. Early icons first presented in The Store 1961 find their first expression in their pages along with subjects for the later large-scale collaborations with Coosje van Bruggen. 

As physical manifestations of thought, these amalgams of magazine clippings, drawings and typed or written notes provide a unique and compelling view of one of America's most important living artists.
