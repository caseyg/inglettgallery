Susan Inglett is pleased to represent recent editions from the Collaborative Workshop at the University of South Florida, Graphicstudio. Featured artists include Chuck Close, Guillermo Kuitca, Kiki Smith, and Richard Tuttle. The exhibition will continue from 13 March 2003 to 19 April 2003 

Graphicstudio was founded in the late Sixties and to date has worked with over sixty leading artists to produce more than 400 limited editions in intaglio, photogravure, lithography, relief, serigraphy, sculpture and artist books. In addition to its publishing, Graphicstudio carries out a program of research and education including technical workshops, conferences, tours, lectures and publications. 

Well known and respected in the print world for their technical inventiveness, Graphicstudio does not disappoint with these new projects. For the piece “Lorna”, Chuck Close has worked with the studio to fully exploit the possibilities of photogravure creating a monumental portrait of the artist, Lorna Simpson. Measuring almost four feet in height the work is larger than life, it’s size and stature artfully projecting the strength and pride of his friend and colleague. Guillermo Kuitca also worked closely with the program to find a medium best suited to his most recent series of maps. “The Neufert Suite” co-opts the medium of cyanotype, traditionally linked with architectural practice, to render a series of floor plans. Work space, casino, gym, church, Kuitca suggests the relationship of people to space and “the Human need to impose order on the space we occupy” (Eleanor Heartney, Artnews). Providing further support for Graphicstudio’s reputation for invention, the woodcuts for the artist book by Kiki Smith, “The Vitreous Body”, were made using a process of their own invention, the heliorelief. The book is an extraordinary example of its kind, a perfect meeting of concept and craft as the translucent vellum of the page suggests skin and light, the die-cuts becoming bodily orifices. Likewise, Richard Tuttle challenged the studio not only with his series of encaustic painting on muslin, but with the very definition of edition itself. 

The exhibition will be on view at the Susan Inglett Gallery located 100 Wooster Street/2 Floor Tuesday to Saturday 11 AM to 6 PM. For additional information, please contact Susan Inglett at 212/343-0573 and fax 212/343-0574.
