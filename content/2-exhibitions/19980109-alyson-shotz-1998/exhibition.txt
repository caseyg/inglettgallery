Susan Inglett is pleased to present the photographs, sculpture and video work of ALYSON SHOTZ from 9 January 1998 to 14 February 1998. A reception for the artist will be held Friday evening 9 January from 6 to 8 PM. 

In this second exhibition at the Gallery, Alyson Shotz continues her examination of Man’s ambiguous and complex relationship to Nature at the start of the new Millennium. Recent developments in the Sciences have made permeable many of the barriers previously distinguishing animal from plant, Man and his environment. In a variety of media, the artist focuses on a lone figure encased from head to toe in a sparkling, reflective suit of mirrors. The video and photographs capture this alien as it moves discreetly through the forest in an effort to mimic and meld with the environment. 

Despite extraordinary efforts, the charade is laid bare by the creature’s awkward movements and impaired vision thanks to the unnatural bulk and elaborate character of the second skin. With great beauty and poignancy, the performance delineates humanity’s hapless attempts to mimic and to reproduce Nature in all of its intricate finery.
