Susan Inglett is pleased to present an installation and works on paper by ALYSON SHOTZ from 5 April to 18 May 1996. A reception for the artist will be held the evening of 5 April from 6 to 8 PM. 

Following a frenzy of recent discovery in the genetic sciences, Man has found himself in the intoxicating role of Creator. Once content to observe, genetic engineering has made it possible for scientists to tamper with the very essence of life. The transference of genetic material from one animal to another of related or unrelated species, from animal to plant is all within the realm of possibility. While immediately seductive, it remains to be seen what the long term physical, spiritual, and psychological effects will be. 

Alyson Shotz examines this new permeable landscape. Fragile plant, animal and mineral structures no longer exist as discreet entities, but have mutated into one teeming fleshy mass - a vast tangle of confused genetic material. This is an environment which has been biologically and genetically engineered, an un-natural world pumped up on Acid, steroids, spliced and diced...hallucinatory, color saturated, and bigger than life.
