Susan Inglett is pleased to present the first solo exhibition of the sculptural and photographic work of Eli Ping from 27 November to 11 December 2007. A reception for the artist will be held Thursday evening 29 November from 6 to 8 PM. Concurrently Gallery II will feature a new series of etchings by Anna Gaskell, “Atonement”, published by the gallery’s I.C. Editions. 

Broken fragments of ceramic figurines form the basis for Eli Ping’s monumental constructs. Shifting between gestural abstraction and fragmented narrative, the resulting forms balance precariously between ascendence and collapse.

Ping’s work has been exhibited most recently in group shows at Gavin Brown’s Project, Artist’s Space, Deitch Projects, and the Rooseum Malmo. This exhibition is the artist’s first solo show.
