SUSAN INGLETT is pleased to present an exhibition of recent paintings by Robin Kahn opening 14 September to 28 October 1995. A reception will be held 6 to 8 PM the evening of 14 September. 

Working with a variety of source materials from textbooks to popular journals, Robin Kahn creates a visual pastiche of the female gender on canvas. Heroic images of Superwoman, the Gibson Girl, and Leda are generously sprinkled with layers of female body parts, symbols and caricatures. While the act of selection suggests a personal vision, the fact that each illustration has been drawn from the collective image bank encourages a larger reading. 

By limiting her gender representations to the visual vocabulary of societies past and present, Kahn's surveys reflect a woman's role as seen through the public eye without correcting for astigmatism or short-sightedness. 

While Kahn's paintings draw on existing language, her most recent publication is intended to expand the vocabulary. Time Capsule : A Concise Encyclopedia by Women Artists collects both visual and written messages from women in the international art community. 

The 700 page anthology has been published by Creative Time, a not-for-profit public arts organization, on the occasion of the Fourth International Women's Conference (Beijing). 

Time Capsule joins earlier anthologies, Promotional Copy (1993) and Special Issue (1992), edited by Robin Kahn and the open collaborative S.O.S. Int'l as public artworks. We are pleased to celebrate both the publication of Time Capsule and this most recent body of work from Robin Kahn.
