Susan Inglett is pleased to present the work of BONNIE COLLURA in the project space from 19 March to 17 April 2004. 

Expanding upon ideas developed for an earlier exhibition in the main gallery, Bonnie Collura fills the project space with paintings on paper and two new small scale sculptures. The works on paper, as the sculpture, find their inspiration in a history and mythology enhanced and glorified through centuries of retelling and human embellishment. Collura cites Snow White as her muse, not so much for her attributes as for her lineage and birth as a Disney character. Adapted from a line drawing of Prosperina sketched for the studio's first animations, Greek goddess becomes German fairy tale princess becomes American icon. Collura follows a similar course as she cobbles together a contemporary pantheon from the figures of ancient legend and modern day cartoons.

Bonnie Collura has exhibited recently in both solo and group exhibitions at the Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield; the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas; the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.
