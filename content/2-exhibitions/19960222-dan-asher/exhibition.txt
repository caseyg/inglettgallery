Susan Inglett is pleased to exhibit the work of DAN ASHER from 22 February to 30 March. A reception for the artist will be held the evening of 22 February from 6 to 8 PM. 

An American, Dan Asher has been living and working in Koln Germany since the late Eighties. While exhibiting extensively in Europe including solo museum shows at the Kunstmuseum Winterthur, De Pont Foundation Tilburg, and Kunstverein Dusseldorf, this will be his first solo show in the United States in ten years. 

The exhibition at the gallery will include drawing and sculpture. Although two distinct and independent bodies of work, together they weave a complex tale. Intimate and contemplative, Asher's figure drawing emphasizes the spiritual side of Man. The head, or psyche, is rendered in obsessive detail while the body is described in several wispy gestures. 

Similar gestures dominate the sculpture which is bolder and far more physical in nature. Expressing Man's instinctual side, these clay pieces explode with energy. When seen together the work both illustrates and exhibits the range of human behavior, from quiet meditation to raw emotion. The drawings and sculpture expose Man's dual nature, both cerebral and corporeal, a struggle or balance of mind and body.
