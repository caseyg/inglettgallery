Fall 2016 marks the 25th Anniversary of the founding of our publishing company, I.C. Editions, Inc.  
What better time to pause and celebrate the accomplishment and everyone who has contributed in blood, sweat and tears to see it through.

Beginning with the many talented and generous artists, my unending gratitude and thanks to Barbara Bloom, Bruce Conner, Marcel Dzama, Anna Gaskell, George Herms, Barbara Kruger, Annette Lemieux, Sol LeWitt, Allan McCollum, Paul Noble, Claes Oldenburg, Robyn O’Neil, Catherine Opie, Raymond Pettibon, Rona Pondick, Richard Prince, Erika Rothenberg, Allen Ruppersberg, Dana Schutz, Simone Shubuck, Aaron Spangler, Jessica Stockholder, Philip Taaffe, Fred Tomaselli, Lawrence Weiner, Terry Winters and Andrea Zittel. Never forgetting the equally talented printers without whom no print would ever be the same… including Robert Arbor at Arbor and Son, New Mexico; Mike Ward at Atlas Print Studio, London; Kay Bradner, San Francisco; Brand X Editions, NYC; Greg Burnet at Burnet Editions, NYC; Maurice Sanchez at Derriere l’Etoile Studios, NYC; George Stavila at GW Manufacturing, Ridgewood; John Greco at Josephine Press, Santa Monica; Kayrock Screeprinting, Brooklyn; Nathan Lieb, Brooklyn; Patrick Neufeld at the Martha Street Studio, Manitoba Printmakers Association; Jean-Yves Noblet, Brooklyn; Jon Lee at PR.I.N.T. University of North Texas, Denton; Sculpture House Castings, NYC and Ian Cooper, Brooklyn; Anne Noonan at Soho Letterpress, NYC; Hugh Stoneman at Stoneman Graphics, Cornwall; Bruce Porter at Trestle Editions, NYC; and Michael Smart at Urban Aesthetics, Brooklyn. 
We are grateful for the kindness of others who provided a place and an opportunity to show our editions, including but not limited to the Palladium, Ellen’s living room, my living room, the museum shops at the Cooper Hewitt Museum, MOCA, Los Angeles; The Jewish Museum, NYC; The Metropolitan Museum, NYC; Printed Matter, NYC; Art Metropole, the galleries hosting “Multiplicity,” a group exhibition of young publishers and the precursor to the Editions | Artists’ Book Fair: Thea Westreich, NYC; Christopher Middendorf, Washington, DC; Van Straaten Gallery, Chicago; Center of Contemporary Art, St. Louis; Davis /McClain, Houston; Richard Green, Santa Monica; and Ellen Miller/Katie Block, Boston. Not having learned our lesson, we followed up with “The Stationary Store,” an exhibition of prints and multiples for Fotouhi Fine Art, East Hampton, then “Extra-Ordinary” at Printed Matter and finally “Press-On,” for our first space in 1994. As an extension of this activity in 1998, Susan Inglett, with Printed Matter and Brooke Alexander Editions, initiated the Editions | Artists’ Book Fair to showcase the many exciting young artists and publishers then entering the field. We continued to organize the E|AB Fair for 15 years growing to include over 60 international publishers and spinning off Printed Matter’s own New York Book Fair while inspiring the creation of Christie’s London Multiplied. More conventionally, I.C. Editions has also participated in Art Basel, Basel; Art Multiple, Dusseldorf; Art Chicago; and the Baltimore Print Fair.

Editions may be found in museum collections from the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, including: Addison Gallery, Andover, MA; Allen Art Museum, Oberlin College, OH; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada; Art Institute of Chicago, IL; Bowdoin College Museum, Brunswick, ME; Brooklyn Museum of Art, Brooklyn, NY; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France; Cleveland Museum, Cleveland, OH; Colorado University Art Museum, Boulder, CO; Cooper-Hewitt Museum, NYC; Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines, IA; Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, MA; Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA; Grinnell College, Grinnell, IA; Hammer Museum, University of California, Los Angeles, CA; High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA; Krannert Art Museum, Champaign, IL; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA; Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, CA; Metropolitan Museum of Art, NYC; Milwaukee Art Museum, Milwaukee, WI; Morgan Library, NYC; Musee d'Art Contemporain, Lausanne, France; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, IL; Museum of Contemporary Art, Honolulu, HI; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA; Museum of Modern Art, NYC; National Museum of Women in the Arts, DC; New Museum of Contemporary Art, NYC; New School for Social Research, NYC; New York Public Library, NYC; Progressive Corporation, Mayfield Village, OH; Queensland Art Gallery, South Brisbane, Australia; Saatchi Collection, London, UK; Sammlung Goetz, Munich, Germany; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA; Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, Germany; Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent, Belgium; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Tate Gallery, London; The Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, MA; Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, OH; University of Connecticut Benton Museum of Art, Storrs, CT; Vanderbilt Fine Arts Gallery, Nashville, TN; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN; Washington University Gallery of Art, St. Louis, MO; Wellesley College Davis Museum, Wellesley, MA; Whitney Museum of American Art, NYC.
