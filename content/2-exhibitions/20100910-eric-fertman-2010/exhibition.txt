Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...”(ominous laugh, cue music).

Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present the work of Eric Fertman in his second solo exhibition with the Gallery. The show will consist of sculpture and works on paper. A reception for the artist will be held Friday evening 10 September from 6 to 8 PM.

We look onto a darkened stage with sets built of battered planks, hot pink, sheltering a ragtag collection of apparitions and shades. Shadows to solids, this mysterious band of umbraes would be impossible to identify were it not for the characteristic tilt of the head, the isolated gesture, the defining bulge. We look for the familiar clues, seeking to fill the void and projecting bits of ourselves onto their blank screen. These props or sculptures become receptacles for our most private thoughts and memories, dream-catchers for the
insomniac.

Eric Fertman graduated from Cooper Union in Manhattan. His work has been seen at the Sculpture Center, Museum 52, Guild and Greyshkul, in “Off the Books! curated by Benjamin Degen and the “Brucennial” with the Bruce High Quality Foundation.
