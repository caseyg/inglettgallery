Susan Inglett is pleased to present the paintings of OONA RATCLIFFE from 14 October to 13 November 2004.

Oona Ratcliffe's paintings are complex, layered, opulent, sensational. These pictures succeed in capturing the experience of being in the world in the 21st Century. At once flamboyantly seductive and inexplicably discomforting, saturated color fields and kinetic compositions cause the eye to skirt frenetically across the paintings' surface. There is no rest in this place, this landscape buzzing with constant activity. The driving spirit of Ratcliffe's work celebrates the contemporary experience, a life lived in full color.
