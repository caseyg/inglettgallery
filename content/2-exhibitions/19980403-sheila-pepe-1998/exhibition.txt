Susan Inglett is pleased to present works from the Doppelganger and Photogram Projection series by Sheila Pepe from 3 April 1998 to 9 May 1998. There will be a reception for the artist from 6 to 8 PM Friday evening 3 April. 

Sheila Pepe's installations include drawing, sculpture, photographic process, and crochet. In her own words the "aim is to shed the skins that define categories, and learn to understand connectivity and difference anew; all the while uncovering and tolerating the discomfort of ambiguity". 

In other hands the sculptural objects created from bits of wire and cloth or the exquisite deep blue cyanotypes would be an end. For Pepe they signal the beginning, inspiring the whimsical wall drawings suggested by the Doppelganger's shadows or more elaborate renderings found among the shapes and forms produced in the Photograms. Sheila Pepe's work provides a springboard for the imagination, both the artist's and our own.
