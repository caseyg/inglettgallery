Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present an exhibition of prints and multiples published by I.C. Editions running from 16 October to 15 November 2003. The exhibition will be the second at her new location 535 West 22 Street, 6 Floor. This exhibition is timed to coincide with the sixth installment of the Editions and Artists’ Books Fair, co-organized annually by Susan Inglett, Brooke Alexander Gallery and Printed Matter. The Fair will take place from 6 to 9 November at 601 West 26 Street on the 14 Floor. 

I.C. Editions was established by Susan Inglett in 1991 to publish the work of young and mid-career artists and to heighten awareness of the medium. To date she has published work by Barbara Bloom, Bruce Conner, Jessica Diamond, Annette Lemieux, Allan McCollum, Paul Noble, Claes Oldenburg, Catherine Opie, Rona Pondick, Richard Prince, Erika Rothenberg, Allen Ruppersberg, Terry Winters and Andrea Zittel. Activities in her Soho space ranged from print demonstrations and lectures, to early realizations of the Editions Fair, to exhibitions of the artist’s editions in the larger context of their unique work. Inglett was also responsible for the organization of a number of exhibitions seen locally and nationally focusing on the print and multiple medium. 

Her recent move to Chelsea provides an opportunity to review the last decade and to introduce the work of I.C. Editions to a new audience. Throughout the month we will be exhibiting the various projects in rotation. To get the party started your invited to Barbara Bloom’s A Birthday Party for Everything where the menu will feature Claes Oldenburg’s NYC Pretzel. We’ll follow with an introduction to the alternative universe of Bruce Conner and Paul Noble followed by entree to the parallel universe of Catherine Opie and Richard Prince. The final weeks will feature the architectures of Terry Winters and Andrea Zittel with a parting THANKS from Allan McCollum.
