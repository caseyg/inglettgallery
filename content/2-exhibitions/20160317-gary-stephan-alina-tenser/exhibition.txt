Susan Inglett Gallery presents new work by Gary Stephan and Alina Tenser from 17 March to 23 April 2016. A reception for the artists will be held Thursday evening 17 March, from 6 to 8 PM.

On first approach Gary Stephan’s (b. 1942) paintings present as a strictly formal affair. A quick read reveals modernist compositions constructed from a circumscribed collection of shapes, palette, and strokes. That the components are familiar and the pieces appear to fall into place is part of the seduction. Stephan is not interested in the neutral reception of his work, but engaging the viewer as co-conspirator or co-constructor in a new reality. Looking to the fundamental conundrum of painting presented by the transference of objects to a flat surface, Stephan’s work toggles endlessly back and forth between statement of fact and fiction. The vacillation is the thing. Images surface only to re-submerge below a welter of webbing and glyphs, neither stroke nor illusion prevails.

Alina Tenser’s (b. 1981) sculpture and video share a vocabulary with Gary Stephan, where all good conversation begins.  The glyphs and lozenges that allude to real objects and real space in Stephan’s work quite literally glide across the surface of Tenser’s. They skitter, skate, collide, and ultimately come to a rest, balancing somewhere between furniture slides and pure geometry. Teetering between image and object, the thing and the thing itself. Writing on Stephan’s work, David Levi Strauss observes that the work is a“conversation—with the visible world, first, the world of appearances, and then with other engaged observers. Each (piece) is an invitation, carefully and generously proffered.”  Tenser and Stephan’s is a dynamic repartee, a conversation in which we are both witness and active participant.

The Gallery will publish a catalogue with an original essay by Raphael Rubinstein and a conversation between Gary Stephan and Alina Tenser on the occasion of the exhibition.

GARY STEPHAN was born in Brooklyn, NY. He attended Pratt Institute, NYC and received his MFA from San Francisco Art Institute.
