Susan Inglett is pleased to present THE INFORMATION AGE curated by David Platzker, Director of Printed Matter, from 14 May 1998 to 27 June 1998. 

From 1969 to 1971 no fewer than five major exhibitions were organized internationally that focused on dematerialized art, art stripped of all previously acknowledged "art signals." Largely this art was neither traditional painting on canvas, refined sculpture, or even a tangible object. Rather it was defined by artists such as John Baldessari, Robert Barry, Lawrence Weiner and others to be an art that was as broad as could be conceived intellectually, and physically as narrow as words on paper. Critically it became known as "Conceptual Art". 

Three of these exhibitions were held in prominent New York City museums and helped to define the artistic movement and moment in time. Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects held at the New York Cultural Center, 10 April to 25 August 1970; Information at the Museum of Modern Art, 2 July to 20 September 1970; and Software at the Jewish Museum, 16 September to 8 November 1971. Each of these three shows looked at similar groups of artists through different lens. 

Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects was the most tightly curated exhibition presenting perhaps the most explicit examples of dematerialized art ; Information was the broadest of the three presentations, taking into consideration the whole burgeoning world of information sources; Software was the first major exhibition to meld art and computer technology into one show, including within the exhibition Wired magazine's Senior Columnist Nicholas Negroponte and his newly founded MIT Media Lab. The Information Age revisits some of the original art works presented in these three exhibitions as a contemporary catharsis - an attempt to refresh our sensibilities in an age of third and fourth generation Conceptual art. Not unlike a story or quote which suffers from constant repetition or recontextualization, this exhibition returns us to the original article so that we might then look more clearly on our own place in time.
