Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present the work of Eric Fertman in his first solo exhibition with the Gallery. The show will consist of sculpture and works on paper. A reception for the artist will be held Thursday evening 8 January from 6 to 8 PM.

Monuments to both past and future, Eric Fertman’s wooden constructs take root in the imagination suggesting new possibilities forged from ancient and modern histories. Drawing upon the Russian Suprematists and Philip Guston, film noir and the Sunday comics, the work gallops through time on Olive Oyl’s oversized shoes. Seamlessly mixing high and low culture, the artist assigns equal value to Malevich as to Raymond Chandler. Working in wood and metal, Fertman inflects these inert materials with humor and humanity, charming both object and viewer in the process.

Eric Fertman graduated from Cooper Union in Manhattan. His work has been seen at the Sculpture Center, Rivington Arms, Roberts & Tilton Gallery and most recently at Museum 52.
