Susan Inglett and I.C. Editions are pleased to present a new edition and related works on paper by TERRY WINTERS from 14 September to 28 October 2000.

Terry Winters is a painter whose abstract images are informed by a wide variety of sources including architectural drawings, medical photographs and computer graphics as well as direct observation. His works elide the distinctions between natural and cultural, real and artificial, organic and mechanical.

Location Plan is related to a series of drawings included in a recent exhibition at the Kunsthalle Basel. Inspired by advanced imaging technologies from information mapping systems to spatial renderings, the drawings explore a dialogue between order and disorder. In the print Winters combines thirty unique images in a grid or storyboard which seems to serve as a key to his current investigations. Moving from one image to the next, through ever-shifting relationships, a sense of flux develops suggesting weather patterns, emotional states, urban dynamics. A similar configuration of these drawn images was used in a 30 by 60 foot backdrop in a recent collaboration with choreographer Trisha Brown and composer Dave Douglas.

Location Plan is a single color screenprint in an edition of 100 published by I.C. Editions, NYC and printed at Brand X, NYC. The print is signed and dated (2000) in the lower left. The paper is architect’s Clearprint fade-out cotton vellum graph paper hand-torn to 29” by 42”.
