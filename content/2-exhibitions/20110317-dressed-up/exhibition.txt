Susan Inglett Gallery is pleased to present new works by Marcia Kure in her first solo exhibition at the Gallery from 17 March to 23 April 2011. A percentage of the proceeds from the exhibition will be donated to the Japanese Red Cross Society for Relief in Japan and Geoffrey Canada’s Harlem Children’s Zone. A reception for the artist will be held Thursday evening, 17 March from 6 to 8 PM. 

“Dressed Up” was conceived while conducting research at the Smithsonian Archives as a Smithsonian Artist-Fellow in 2008. The series consists of full-length photomontage portraits of characters dressed in runway mash-ups drawn from two distinct cultural eras: the 19th Century Victorian and present day hip-hop. The Victorian era, the Age of Empire and colonization, while no longer “in fashion” remains salient in the post-colonial age through remnants of oppressive global, political, and economic structures and systems. In contrast, Hip-hop fashion was originally conceived as part of a performative, radical, social politic in the United States. The attendant music and lifestyle served as powerful platforms from which to challenge entrenched systems of sartorial propriety. 

“Dressed Up” explores symbolic codes of high fashion as imagined by hip-hop avatars and designers of historical haute couture. In bringing the two traditions into direct confrontation, these photomontages play on preconceptions as well as the manner in which we imagine or project personality through dress. The series suggests that the sense of decorum and gravitas conveyed by haute couture/ Victorian fashion belies the colonial violence and decadence of that age; conversely, the near criminalization of hip-hop fashion fails to contend with the humanity of many of its avatars or their status as respectable global citizens. 

The “Dressed Up” series is an irreverent essay on the hybridity and syncretism of contemporary postco- lonial society. The photomontages speak to the unpredictability of the outcome of encounters between the self and its other, between the old and the new, between the normative and the extraordinary.
