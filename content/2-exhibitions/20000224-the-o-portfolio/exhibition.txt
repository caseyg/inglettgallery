SUSAN INGLETT and I.C. Editions are pleased to present CATHERINE OPIE’s “O” portfolio, the artist’s first edition of photogravure from 24 February to 1 April. 

Trained in both classical photographic techniques and as a conceptual artist, Cathy Opie puts history in the service of contemporary thought. In her earlier photodocumentary work from the Portrait series, Opie shows the influence of August Sander and 17th century Dutch portraiture. Tradition and formal concerns bring dignity and grace to her contemporary subjects, California’s pierced and tattooed gay and lesbian community. 

Having left this portrait work aside for a number of years, Opie picks up the raw thread with her recent “O” portfolio.	Similarly this project draws upon the past, the recent past and Robert Mapplethorpe’s controversial “X” portfolio. While Mapplethorpe chose to represent his own exclusively male S&M scene, Opie responds with her equivalent of females. Where Mapplethorpe is harsh, Opie is tender; where he is explicit, she is subtle; both eloquent and compelling in their own right. 

The exhibition will include the seven images from Cathy Opie’s “O” portfolio, a new publication from I.C. Editions, along with a selection of images from Mapplethorpe’s “X”.
