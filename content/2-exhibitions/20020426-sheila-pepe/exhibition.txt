Susan Inglett is pleased to present a new installation by Sheila Pepe from 26 April to 1 June 2002. There will be a reception for the artist from 6 to 8 PM Friday evening 26 April. 

Her second exhibition at the Gallery, Sheila Pepe has marked time between shows by creating large scale site specific works for the museum at Wesleyan College; Colgate University; Grinnell College; the Weatherspoon Art Museum; the Boston Atheneum; P.S. 1's "Greater New York"; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia. Pepe has recently topped off her hiatus from gallery exhibitions with a Tiffany Grant. 

Weaving together lengths of yarn, shoelace and rubberband, Pepe transforms light and space into flights of fantasy. Shadows cast by Brobdingnagian nets inspire the delicate wall drawings which are their antithesis, light and ethereal in constrast to a ponderous source. Pepe's webs act as elaborate dream catchers for the artist, in the process they capture our imaginations as well.
