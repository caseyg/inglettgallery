“Suns” There is no new thing under the sun. And thus Seth Cameron's new paintings aren’t what they are: in this setting, suns. They represent space, misrepresent scale, and present present color. They parse the parts of painting worth painting about (Figure and Ground, Interactions of Color, Shape and Line, etc.) to delight in thecrisis that follows the existential while resisting any ensuing management. With a cocked eye, they pose repose, lean on ledges, and hang in frames, yet do not pretend to escape landscape. They are perfectly fine with it.

“Suns” is Cameron’s first exhibition in New York and with the gallery, properly as himself. And yet improperly neither – his first, in 2008, being both – as a founding member of The Bruce High Quality Foundation. Born in 1982 in South Carolina, Cameron studied at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art where he now leads The Intradisciplinary Seminar. He lives and works in Brooklyn, continuing the work of Bruce and serving as President of the collective’s free art school, BHQFU. 

The exhibitions will be on view at the gallery located at 522 West 24 Street Tuesday to Saturday 10 AM to 6 PM. For additional information please contact Susan Inglett Gallery at 212 647 9111, fax 212 647 9333 or info@inglettgallery.com
