Susan Inglett is pleased to exhibit the graphic work of BRUCE CONNER from 1957 to 1991. The show will run 2 November to 16 December. A reception for the artist will be held the evening of 10 November from 6 to 8 PM. 

During the late Fifties, Bruce Conner along with Wallace Berman, Jay DeFeo, George Herms, Jess, and poet Michael McClure, forged an artistic alliance outside of the mainstream which came to be identified with the Beat generation. While perhaps best known for his assemblage and film work, activity in these areas has been curtailed at various times in his career. It is the work on paper which has prevailed and serves to document changing interests and forms throughout. 

Appropriately, the exhibition begins with THUMBPRINT 1965, conceived during Conner's first formal print workshop experience. During this period the artist was marking each of his works with a fingerprint, believing it to be a far more distinctive form of signature. Needless to say when the time came to sign his first edition, the publisher objected to the unorthodox practice. THUMBPRINT emerged from the ensuing chaos. 

More poetic interpretations of the fingerprint appear in later work. Conner's art making and view of the world was very much affected by his use of peyote in 1958. The graphic works from the 1960's and 1970's capture the spirit of his examination of the patterns of the universe, inspired by the celestial skies, the desert landscape, and the complex whorls of the human fingertip. The print medium was well suited to exploring the intricacies and textures of Conner's world. 

The exhibition will also feature collaborations between Conner and Michael McClure, BOOK 1966 and THE ADVENTURES OF A NOVEL IN FOUR CHAPTERS 1991, as well as a series of surreal collages attributed to a fictional artist, THE DENNIS HOPPER ONE MAN SHOW. A nine film anthology transferred to video will run continuously. 

The gallery is proud to present this overview of the graphic work of Bruce Conner. The show will run concurrent with the exhibition Beat Culture and the New America at the Whitney Museum.
