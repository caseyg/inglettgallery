Text: 

Nothing sorts out memories from ordinary moments. Later on they do claim remembrance when they show their scars. That face he had seen was to be the only peacetime image to survive the war. Had he really seen it? Or had he invented that tender moment to prop up the madness to come? 
—Chris Marker, from La Jetée 

From 24 April to 24 May 2008, Susan Inglett and The Bruce High Quality Foundation are pleased to present The Retrospective, a project of The Bruce High Quality Foundation and its first solo exhibition with the gallery.
