Susan Inglett is pleased to present Eli Ping’s third solo exhibition with the gallery from 28 April to 4 June 2011. A reception for the artist will be held Thursday evening 28 April from 6 to 8 PM. 

A bold, dynamic interplay between texture and color, Eli Ping’s works transgress the constraints of formal and material convention. Ping borrows liberally from the expressive, gestural realm of painting while exploring the tactile and three-dimensional possibilities of sculpture. His twisted canvas pieces lend insight into the involved, multifaceted nature of his process, where repeated layering, gouging and molding are the collaborative push and pull between artist and material, creating forms that are as complex as they are beautiful. The considered actions and gestures Ping performs on his materials are countered by the unpredictable effects of weight and gravity. In each work, the limits of materiality are expounded upon, boundaries are pushed. Ping’s is a work which explores a precarious and unique balance between intention and chance. 

Ping’s work has been exhibited in group shows at Gavin Brown’s Project, Artist’s Space, Deitch Projects and the Rooseum Malmö. Earlier this year, Ping curated the group show “In Side Out” at Susan Inglett Gallery. He curates regularly for the exhibition space Regina Rex.
