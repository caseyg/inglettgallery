Susan Inglett is pleased to present recent editions from Columbia University’s LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies. Projects include work from Ellen Gallagher, Elliott Green, Alexis Rockman and Kiki Smith. The exhibition will continue from 12 April 2001 to 19 May 2001. 

The LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies was founded in the late NIneties to promote printmaking through education, production and the exhibition of prints. While the Center’s mission statement may not distinguish it from any number of organizations established to further the medium, the manner in which Columbia pursues its goal does. Each year several artists are invited to work with students and a master printer at Columbia’s state of the art facility. The Center has the enviable capacity to produce prints in intaglio, lithography, silkscreen, relief, photography, and digital imaging. 

“Untitled”, Columbia’s recent edition with Ellen Gallagher perfectly illustrates the workshop’s approach to printmaking from both a technical and philosophical standpoint. A portfolio of ten prints, the project incorporates etching, drypoint, screenprint, chine colle, lithography and embossment alone and in combination. As Gallagher conceives of her painting exhibitions “not as singular works but cosmologies with related parts”, the portfolio format and Columbia’s accommodating environment provide the perfect vehicle for her working method. The project took shape over the course of two years as Gallagher developed her ideas and the studio responded. The results are extraordinary, the project manages to convey Gallagher’s spirit while suggesting the creative synergy which comes from a successful collaboration. 

At Columbia Ellen Gallagher’s experience is not the exception but the rule. 

Alexis Rockman’s “Mastadon”, “Sabre-Toothed Tiger”, and “Insects” use ink made from LaBrea tar. Elliott Green’s portfolio of images includes a CD-ROM illustrating Green’s working method, drawing followed by erasure followed by drawing ... The always imaginative Kiki Smith recounts her tale of Red Riding Hood punctuated by a paper kerchief on kizukishi paper, hand-cut and folded. Columbia’s dedication to its mission, to the artists and to their students shines forth in each project they undertake. The program should be celebrated as a utopian vision realized.
