Susan Inglett and I.C. Editions are pleased to present a new project from ANDREA ZITTEL, “A-Z Sorting Trays”, for the collector who has everything. The exhibition will run from 7 November to 15 December 2001. 

Over the past decade Andrea Zittel has sought inspiration in daily life, exploring theoretical and social issues through personal design. Recently, while building a new home, Zittel found that the accoutrements of that daily life had become overwhelming. Inspired, the artist designed “A-Z Sorting Trays”. Covering each cluttered surface with paper, Zittel traced patterns for fourteen different trays. Cut from 2” thick Finland Birch and ranging in size from 8 1/2” by 5” to 32” by 22 1/2” there are trays for the kitchen, trays for the dining room, trays for the living room, the bedroom, the bath, the closet, the office, even your A-Z Escape Vehicle. Each tray is further individualized with custom-blended accent colors. 

Multiple designs in multiple sizes, shapes and colors, available in multiple combinations. Just the thing for your nest or nester, and just in time for the holidays. Prices start at $175.00.
