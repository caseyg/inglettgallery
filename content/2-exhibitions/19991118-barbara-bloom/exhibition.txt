SUSAN INGLETT and I.C. Editions are pleased to present a new multiple edition from Barbara Bloom 18 November 1999 to 1 January 2000.	A reception for the artist will be held Saturday afternoon 20 November from 4 PM to 6 PM. 

With this new work Barbara Bloom continues her exploration of the subjects of gifts, table settings, hosts and guests, and scale with a box containing everything necessary to set up a party. 

The edition consists of all the paper products for a childâ€™s party : paper hats, plates, cups, tablecloth, horns, favors, ect.,., each of which is adorned with a pattern. The patterns are made up of images ranging from the very smallest to the very largest of things known to us. Pictures and diagrams of sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, cells, bodily systems, fingerprints, textile patterns, house plans; maps of streets, cities, states, nations, continents, earth; images of the solar system, galaxy, nebulae, the universe... 

The turning from 1999 to 2000 seems as good a moment as any for a party at which all of these dispensable throw aways and favors seem an apt and lovely setting to explore the ephemerality of generosity and giving. 

Please join us in a celebration with ice cream and cake on Saturday afternoon 20 November from 4 to 6 PM. Children welcome.
