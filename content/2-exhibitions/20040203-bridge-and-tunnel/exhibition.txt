Susan Inglett is pleased to present a new installation by SHEILA PEPE, Bridge and Tunnel, from 13 February to 13 March 2004. There will be a reception for the artist from 6 to 8 PM Friday evening 13 February. 

First gaining attention five years ago in Gothic presciently curated by Christoph Grunenberg for the ICA, Boston, Sheila Pepe has subsequently knitted her work into the fabric of many lives.

Her large scale site specific pieces have appeared in exhibitions and museums coast to coast from the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum in California to Grinnell College in Iowa to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia to the Weatherspoon Art Museum in North Carolina to the Boston Atheneum, Wesleyan College and Colgate University in the Northeast and finally back home to Artists Space and the P.S.1/Museum of Modern Art collaboration Greater New York. Running concurrent with her exhibition at the Gallery, Pepe will also be exhibiting with Bernard Toale in Boston followed by an appearance at the Armory Show New York.

Writing in a catalogue essay for Pepe’s exhibition at Colgate University, Helaine Posner observes that the artist finds inspiration in the example of several major 20th century masters. Pepe’s installations look to the all over fields of Jackson Pollock, the expressionist gestures of Franz Kline and Eva Hesse’s choice of nontraditional materials to suggest the organic. Picking up the thread, Sheila Pepe transforms the line from one to three-dimensions, creating space and architecture by weaving together complete environments of yarn, rubber bands and shoelaces. Fundamentally, Pepe alters the physical experience of our immediate space, creating impenetrable borders and boundaries from the most ephemeral of materials. Subliminally, she alters our perception and preconceptions, attaching significance and weight to a fragile thread. Sheila Pepe’s environments lend credence to the simple and lowly, while her scale and ambition gives newfound appreciation for all such humble beginnings.
