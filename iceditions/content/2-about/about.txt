About:

I.C. Editions, Inc. was established by Susan Inglett in 1991 to publish the work of both young and mid-career artists and to heighten awareness of the medium. To date she has published prints and multiples by a wide range of artists including Barbara Bloom, Bruce Conner, Allan McCollum, Paul Noble, Claes Oldenburg, Catherine Opie, Richard Prince, Terry Winters and Andrea Zittel.

In 1994 Susan Inglett Gallery was founded to exhibit these publications as well as the unique work of emerging and established artists. Activities in the gallery have ranged from print demonstrations and lectures, to early realizations of the Editions/Artists’ Book Fair, to exhibitions of the artist’s editions within the larger context of their unique work. Inglett has also been responsible for the organization of a number of exhibitions seen locally and nationally focusing on the print and multiple medium. In November 1998 Susan Inglett, in cooperation with Printed Matter and Brooke Alexander Editions, organized the first Editions/Artists’ Book Fair which continues today.
