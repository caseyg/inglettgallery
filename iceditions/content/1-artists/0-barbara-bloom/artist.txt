BARBARA BLOOM’s A Birthday Party for Everything, includes the essential ingredients for a picture perfect party in a convenient carrying case. No occasion would be complete without party hats and horns, plates, cups, napkins, and favors including puzzles, frisbees, wooden tops, yo-yos, kaleidoscopes, pinwheels, fans, bubbles, candy, and balloons. The artist makes this party her own and ours by festooning each surface with images ranging from the sub-atomic to the universal, from molecular structures to bodily systems to street maps to cityscapes to world views to the moon.

A Birthday Party for Everything is quite simply a celebration of life.

Barbara Bloom’s work has been seen most recently in the exhibition "As it were...So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue with Barbara Bloom" at The Jewish Museum in NYC 2013. Also, "The Collections of Barbara Bloom" at the International Center of Photography NYC. Bloom is represented by Tracy Williams, NYC. A Birthday Party for Everything can be found in the collections of the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago; Cooper-Hewitt Museum, NYC; Museum of Modern Art, NYC; and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.
