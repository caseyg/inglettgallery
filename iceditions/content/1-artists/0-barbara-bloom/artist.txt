BARBARA BLOOM’s A Birthday Party for Everything, includes the essential ingredients for a picture perfect party in a convenient carrying case. No occasion would be complete without party hats and horns, plates, cups, napkins, and favors including puzzles, frisbees, wooden tops, yo-yos, kaleidoscopes, pinwheels, fans, bubbles, candy, and balloons. The artist makes this party her own and ours by festooning each surface with images ranging from the sub-atomic to the universal, from molecular structures to bodily systems to street maps to cityscapes to world views to the moon.

A Birthday Party for Everything is quite simply a celebration of life.
