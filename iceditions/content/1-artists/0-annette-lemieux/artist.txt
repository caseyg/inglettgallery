ANNETTE LEMIEUX, Stolen Faces, 1991, a portfolio of three lithographs printed by Trestle Editions, New York in an edition of twenty-six with five Artist's Proofs published by I.C. Editions, a division of Susan Inglett Gallery. The left and right panel of the triptych each measures 30 1/4" by 22" and center panel 30 1/4" by 44". For this portfolio Lemieux has chosen a multi-racial battalion of soldiers as her subject matter. By employing the pixilated dot, the artist comments not only on the ability of war to render all men equal in the face of battle, but on the rather facile attempts by our government and the media to protect the innocent. The side panels mirror one another in color and black and white. The center panel is generated from the pixilated circles of the left and right hand panels.
