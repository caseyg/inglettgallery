CATHERINE OPIE, O, 1999, a portfolio of seven photogravure printed at Burnet Editions, NYC on Durer etching paper in an edition of 26 with 6 Artist’s Proofs, published by I.C. Editions. The O portfolio represents Opie’s first use of photogravure, a female response to Robert Mapplethorpe’s controversial X portfolio. The work was realized exclusively for this project using details of images taken over the course of the year during casual studio shoots with friends. Photogravure was chosen to soften already subtle images and for its history of use by Mapplethorpe.The seven sheets are housed in a black cloth box with the letter O debossed on the cover.

The O portfolio can be found in the collections of the Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin; Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines; Grinnell College, Grinnell; Hammer Museum, University of California, Los Angeles; University of Connecticut Benton Museum of Art, Storrs; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the New York Public Library; and Wellesley College Davis Museum, Wellesley.
