Terry Winterâ€™s Location Plan is a single color screenprint in an edition of 100 published by I.C. Editions, NYC and printed at Brand X, NYC. The print is signed and dated (2000) in the lower left. The paper is Clearprint fade-out cotton vellum blue/white graph paper hand-torn to 29 x 42 in.

Location Plan is related to a series of drawings included in a recent exhibition at the Kunsthalle Basel. Inspired by advanced imaging technologies from information mapping systems to spatial renderings, the drawings explore a dialogue between order and disorder. In the print Winters combines thirty unique images in a grid or storyboard which seems to serve as a key to his current investigations. Moving from one image to the next, through ever-shifting relationships, a sense of flux develops suggesting weather patterns, emotional states, urban dynamics. A similar configuration of these drawn images was used in a 30 by 60 foot backdrop in a recent collaboration with choreographer Trisha Brown and composer Dave Douglas.

Location Plan can be found in the collections of the Addison Gallery, Andover; Colby College Museum, Waterville; Metropolitan Museum of Art, NYC; Museum of Modern Art, NYC; New York Public Library, NYC; University of Michigan Museum of Art, Ann Arbor; and the Vanderbilt Fine Arts Gallery, Nashville.
