Marching single file across a wide open manila field, the army of Marcel Dzama prevails once again. Man, woman, child and/or beast, people this merry band of misfits. Missionaries that they are, Dzama's soldiers travel without portfolio, free to serve at the whim of their respective master. Obediantly, these hybrid creatures act out the fantasies, frustrations, victories of our daily lives and nocturnal reveries.

Marcel Dzama, a Canadian born artist living in Winnipeg, has exhibited widely throughout Europe and the United States. He is also a member of the artists' collective Royal Art Lodge. Dzama is represented by the David Zwirner Gallery, NYC.

This portfolio, Dzama's first, is in the collection of the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge; the Museum of Modern Art, NYC; and the New York Public Library, NYC.
