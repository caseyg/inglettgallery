A figure struggles, her body morphing ineluctably between unruly animal and contrite child. Her entrapment resonates with the minotaur of Jorge Luis Borges' "The House of Asterion," imprisoned behind unlocked doors surrounded by ample empty space. Her penance parallels that of Carlo Collodi's puppet “Pinocchio", whose physical transformation to beast follows that fateful trip to Pleasure Island. The punishment hardly fits the crime, yet the woman embraces the penalty in the hopes of atonement.

Anna Gaskell is represented by Yvon Lambert Gallery, NYC/Paris. Gaskell’s work has been the subject of numerous solo museum exhibitions, most recently at the Menil Collection, Houston; The Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover; the Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami among others.
