Fred Tomaselli begins this foray into the nature of nature and its intersection with the psyche and the cosmos with leaves from his own garden. The pattern laid down creates a base for radiating rings of color which burst forth full bloom from each individual pad. The result is lush and hypnotic, a ready made mandala for modern man.
