The presciently titled Backstroke was published to benefit the 2012 Editions | Artists' Book Fair, postponed due to the effects of what was considered the largest storm system to ever hit the Atlantic Coast. A story of redemption and renewal, the Fair was rescheduled to run 23 to 27 January 2013 (www.eabfair.com). Proceeds from the sale of the print will ensure the realization of this memorable event and celebration, the 15th anniversary of the Editions | Artists' Book Fair.
