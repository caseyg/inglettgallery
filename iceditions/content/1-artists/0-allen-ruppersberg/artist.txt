ALLEN RUPPERSBERG, Remainders, a multiple in edition of 12 with 4 Artist Proofs. Each piece consists of approximately one hundred novels created by the artist and one display table. Sixteen different jacket covers were printed from collages of popular literature and culture. Using film stills, the pages of each book create a jumbled narrative meant to mimic the reader's stream of unconsciousness. To quote Stephane Mallarme, "A book neither begins nor ends: at most, it pretends." Remainders can be found in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Museum of Modern Art, NYC; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis and the Whitney Museum of American Art, NYC.
