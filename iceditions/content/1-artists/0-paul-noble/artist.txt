Paul Noble has devoted his recent years to the creation of Nobson Newtown, a new town built according to the perceived needs and preferences of its inhabitants. Of course as self-annointed spokesperson, this particular folly tells us as much about the artist as it provides yet another example of questionable city planning. With Nobson Newtown, Noble joins a long line of distinguished artists who have invented fantastic and eccentric worlds through which to explore their own pychological landscape. Located on the outskirts of town, A and Paul’s Place adds sculpture park and sensory respite to a burgeoning Nobson Central replete with Nobspital, Lidonob, and, of course, Paul’s Place.

A and Paul’s Place can be found in the collection of the Tate Gallery, London; the Worcester Art Museum, Worcester; University Art Museum at Colorado State University; Spencer Museum University of Kansas; and Bowdoin College Museum, Brunswick. The project has been seen in exhibitions at Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge and a survey of the artist’s work at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo.
