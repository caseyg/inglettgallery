Philip Taaffe, Molossus, Cernunno, and Acerodont, 2007, a portfolio of three Archival inkjet prints printed by Jean-Yves Noblet, Brooklyn. The portfolio was printed on Somerset paper in an edition of 35 with 8 Artist’s Proofs, published by I.C. Editions, NYC.

Foreign cultures and traditions have frequently found a place in the work of Philip Taaffe. Recent paintings take their cue from the ancient craft of paper marbling while works on paper look to the art of paste paper. Paste paper is a form of decorative paper making which originated in the 16th Century. Brushing colored paste onto wet paper, artisans created designs using found objects and special tools. Taaffe has generously produced three sumptuous examples of this ancient craft which have been editioned for this occasion.

The work may be found in the collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Philip Taaffe was recently honored with a survey exhibition at the Wolfsburg Kunstmuseum, Germany and has been the subject of solo museum exhibitions at the Galleria Civica of Trento, Italy and the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in San Mariono, Italy. He was also included in the Carnegie International, two Sydney Biennials, and three Whitney Biennials. Taaffe presently resides and works in New York City.
