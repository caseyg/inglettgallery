JESSICA STOCKHOLDER, With your Salad, 2006 a multiple conceived by the artist of various found materials with original plastic resin addition fabricated by Sculpture House Casting, NYC. Final production by Ian Cooper, Brooklyn.

Jessica Stockholder is trained as both sculptor and painter, each discipline is well represented in With your Salad. Red plastic cooler, brushed aluminum wall sconce, neon extension cord and artistic folly meet in a riot of color, texture, and light.While Stockholder credits a surrealist’s game of chance as the starting point for her work, she proceeds to masterfully weave an inspired web of flotsam and jetsam which she personalizes with a plastic splash of Tropicana Cabana and Lime Green. In the artist’s hands, the commonplace acquires heightened stature while the exotic gains parity with the ordinary. One man’s junk is another’s man’s treasure.

With your Salad can be found in the collection of the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence and the University Art Museum at Colorado State University.
