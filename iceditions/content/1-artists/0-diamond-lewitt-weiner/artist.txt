A DO-IT-YOURSELF kit containing paper, pencil, stencil, overhead transparency, diagrams and complete instructions for 1 JESSICA DIAMOND, 1 SOL LEWITT, and 1 LAWRENCE WEINER. In a good-humored way, DO-IT-YOURSELF captures the essence of conceptual art. Each artist has contributed a concept, the execution of which is left to the collector. By selecting artists of three successive generations, the project emphasizes the adaptability and strength of the movement.

The elements of DO-IT-YOURSELF are housed in a black cloth-covered box measuring 12" by 10 1/2". The label, diagrams, and instruction sheets are printed letterpress on Folio paper by Anne Noonan of Soho Letterpress, NYC. Design by Dan Miller Design, NYC. Published by I.C. Editions, a division of Susan Inglett Gallery.
